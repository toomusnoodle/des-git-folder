# DES-CBC PKCS#5/7

Python implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm, using Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), with PKCS#5/7 padding support for key and plaintext; with also automated testing using pytest.

## Features
- DES encryption of custom plaintext & key
- ASCII input used  
- No maximum for plaintext input, because Cipher Block Chaining with PKCS#5/7 padding is used
- First 8 characters of key input used, PKCS#5/7 padding is applied
- 16 subkeys generated from first 8 bytes of key input
- Initialization vector is generated by os.urandom, so secure but PRNG
- Matrix according to [FIPS 46-3](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/46-3/final/docs/fips46-3.pdf)  
- Binary bitstream of IV concatenated with all ciphertext blocks is converted to hex as final output
- pytest included
